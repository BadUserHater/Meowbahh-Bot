===============SECTION I - SETUP===========================

Here are the steps to set up your own Bad User bot. Keep in mind this is the basic version of the orignal bot.

PACKAGES NEEDED (Included in the requirements.txt file)
- discord.py
- ffmpeg
- PyNaCl
REQUIRED FROM YOURSELF
- Knowledge of discord.py and python
- A discord bot with a bot token and is in your server.

SET UP GUIDE
1. Download or fork this source code to your hosting provider.
2. Create a bot application if not already and copy your bot token
3. Install the required packages needed above if they needed to be installed manually.
4. Paste the bot token at the bottom where it says "BOT TOKEN" without removing the ""
5. Extract the RESOURCES.ZIP file to your root folder of the bot files.
6. CHANGING PREFIX
-- Head to the top where it says: client = commands.Bot(command_prefix = "++")
-- Replace ++ with the prefix you want.
7. Setting up Bot Admins
-- Head to leaders = [757827467657478245]
-- NOTE: 757827467657478245 is a user id of the orignal creator
-- Replace the ID with the ids of the people who want to be your Bot admins. Use commas to seperate
-- Example: leaders = [757827467657478245, 924910621085040690, 302050872383242240]
-- In the example, I just put 3 users to be a Bot Admin

===============SECTION 2 - Bad Users======================

This source code for a bot is intended to make a Bad user trash. Here are some example of bad users

- Lisa Gaming Roblox - Supports CP and deletes people's houses on Bloxburg
- Meowbahh - Racist and wants people to k*ll themselves
- Bella the Wolf - Abused the Military
- BudsForBuddies - Abuses animals.
- Anna - Lets Get Acquainted - A spambot
- That Vegan Teacher - Forces people to become vegan in very dumb ways

You can take your anger out of these users by making a bot based on them.
